Hi, thank you for stopping by my website.
I'm a freelance illustrator and graphic artist currently residing in Queens, New York. Since graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Illustration from the Fashion Institute of Technology, I've devoted myself to creating beautiful work for my clients and for myself. There are certain principles I apply to everything I do. You can expect expert color, composition, and creativity delivered with a diligent work ethic. If you think I would be a good fit for your project give me a call or email me. I'd be happy to work with you to create the perfect art and design for your needs.
